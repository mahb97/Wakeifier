Manifesto: 
tinyllamas on the mound

code needs to stream of consciousness

avoid the binary bore

remember, you are hotter than one hot encoding

machine learning but make it spicyyyy

boys that watch transformers < boys that build transformers

bob perleman's china

i want selfish self attention

berlin deep house mix chris luno (get rejected but with vibes)

i wanna fry your embedding layer 50k my ass i can hand annotate that for you

wet dreams about ethical wetware

I'll grow you language forests and encode the trees
